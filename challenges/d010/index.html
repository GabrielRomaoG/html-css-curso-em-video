        <h1>History of the Android Mascot</h1>

        <p>This is the main content area where you will place the core information of your website.</p>

        <h2 class="main-h2">The First Version</h2>

        <p>The first attempt to create a mascot came in 2007 from a developer named Dan Morrill. He says he opened
            Inkscape (free vector graphics software) and created his own version of a robot. The goal was just to
            personify the system for his team only; there was no request from the company to create a mascot.</p>

        <div class="image-container">
            <picture>
                <source media="(max-width: 1000px)"
                srcset="assets/images/dan-droids-pq.png"
                type="image/png">
                <img src="assets/images/dan-droids.png" alt="dan-droids">
            </picture>
        </div>

        <p>This bizarre first version was even named after its creator: it would be the Dandroids.</p>

        <h2 class="main-h2">A New Mascot Emerges</h2>

        <p>
            The idea of having a mascot matured, and the mission was passed on to a professional in the field. Russian
            illustrator Irina Blok, also a Google employee, was tasked with representing the little robot in a more
            pleasant way.
        </p>

        <div class="image-container">
            <picture >
                <source media="(max-width: 1000px)"
                srcset="assets/images/irina-blok-pq.jpg"
                type="image/jpg">
                <img src="assets/images/irina-blok.jpg" alt="irina-blok">
            </picture>
        </div>

        <p>
            Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with a few strokes and in a more flattened way.
            The drawing should also generate quick identification with whoever looks at it. That's how Bugdroid, the new
            Android mascot, was born.
        </p>

                Another curious thing about Android is that each version has always been named after a candy, in
                alphabetical order from version 1.5 to 9.0.
            </p>

            <ul class="two-column-list ">
                <li>1.5 - Cupcake</li>

                <li>2.2 - Froyo</li>
                <li>2.3 - Gingerbread</li>
                <li>3.0 - Honeycomb</li>

                Unfortunately, Android Q didn't exist, as Google decided to put an end to this fun practice and started
                using numbers, which gave rise to Android 10.

                Access the Android History website here to see the sequence of "sweetened" versions and what each one
                brought to the Android system.
