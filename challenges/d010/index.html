        <h1>History of the Android Mascot</h1>

        <p>
            You probably know that the <strong>Android</strong> operating system, maintained by <strong>Google</strong>, is one of the most used for mobile devices worldwide. But maybe you don't know that its cute mascot has a very curious name and story? Follow this article to learn a lot about this little robot.
        </p>

        <h2 class="main-h2">The First Version</h2>

        <p>
            The first attempt to create a mascot came in 2007 from a developer named <a href="#">Dan Morrill</a>. He says he opened
            Inkscape (free vector graphics software) and created his own version of a robot. The goal was just to
            personify the system for his team only; there was no request from the company to create a mascot.
        </p>

            <img src="assets/images/dan-droids.png" alt="dan-droids">

        <p>This bizarre first version was even named after its creator: it would be the Dandroids.</p>

        <h2>A New Mascot Emerges</h2>

        <p>
            The idea of having a mascot matured, and the mission was passed on to a professional in the field. Russian
            illustrator Irina Blok, also a Google employee, was tasked with representing the little robot in a more
            pleasant way.
        </p>

            <source media="(max-width: 1000px)"
            srcset="assets/images/irina-blok-pq.jpg"
            type="image/jpg">
            <img src="assets/images/irina-blok.jpg" alt="irina-blok">
        </picture>

        <p>
            Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with a few strokes and in a more flattened way.
            The drawing should also generate quick identification with whoever looks at it. That's how Bugdroid, the new
            Android mascot, was born.
        </p>

        <img class="little-img" src="assets/images/bugdroid.png" alt="bugdroid">

        <p>
            The main inspiration for the features of the new Bugdroid came from those little figures that illustrate bathroom doors to indicate the gender of each door. Legend has it that the artist was creating at her desk at the Google office and looked towards the bathrooms and the identification was immediate: simple, clean, objective.

                Another curious thing about Android is that each version has always been named after a candy, in
                alphabetical order from version 1.5 to 9.0.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>1.5 - Cupcake</li>
                <li>1.6 - Donut</li>
                <li>3.0 - Eclair</li>
                <li>2.2 - Froyo</li>
                <li>2.3 - Gingerbread</li>
                <li>3.0 - Honeycomb</li>
                <li>4.0 - Ice Cream Sandwich</li>
                <li>4.1 - Jelly Bean</li>
                <li>4.4 - KitKat</li>
                <li>5.0 - Lolipop</li>
                <li>6.0 - Marshmallow</li>
                <li>7.0 - Nougat</li>
                <li>8.0 - Oreo</li>
                <li>9.0 - Pie</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Unfortunately, Android Q didn't exist, as Google decided to put an end to this fun practice and started
                using numbers, which gave rise to Android 10.
            </p>

            <p>
                Access the Android History website here to see the sequence of "sweetened" versions and what each one
                brought to the Android system.
